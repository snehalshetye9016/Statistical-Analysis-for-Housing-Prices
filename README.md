# Statistical-Analysis-for-Housing-Prices
House prices, unlike stock prices, appear to be predictable with some degree of accuracy. This paper discusses how Regression Theory can help to predict the sales price of houses. The dataset in this paper includes several house features and the sale prices of houses sold in King County, Washington, the 13th-most populous county in the United States, between May 2014 and May 2015. The proposed model predicts the sales price of the house with the mean square prediction error of 0.062. Also, this paper concludes that freeways are the main reason behind the high price of houses.
